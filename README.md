# Survey-Implementation-for-VR-Environments
> This project will help create an automated survey application that can be taken by research participants in a virtual environment. The survey can be generated by modifying the input text file according to the survey owner's requirements. When the participant completes the generated survey, an output file containing the user responses will be generated. This project also enables an easy collection of data for future VR experiments.

## General Information
- VR research experiments and studies generally require extensive use of surveys to collect participant information and data. Some VR experiments would also require participants to embody an avatar and answer questions in a virtual environment to study any effects caused by virtual embodiment. This project aims to provide an automated survey application that will enable researchers to conduct surveys in virtual environments. 
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Unity - version 2018.1.2f1 (64bit)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Provides four different types of questions that can be included in the survey: short-answer, multiple choice, likert scale and dropdown menu. 
- Only requires user to modify the input text file according to the required questions.
- Generates an output file storing the participant's answer along with the corresponding question.
