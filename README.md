# Survey-Implementation-for-VR-Environments
This project will help create an automated survey application that can be taken by research participants in a virtual environment. The survey can be generated by modifying the input text file according to the survey owner's requirements. When the participant completes the generated survey, an output file containing the user responses will be generated. This project also enables an easy collection of data for future VR experiments.
